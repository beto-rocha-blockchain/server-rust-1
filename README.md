## Overview
The **server-rust-1** repository is a Rust-based server implementation developed by **beto-rocha-blockchain**.  
The project primarily uses **Rust (88.0%)** and includes a **Dockerfile (12.0%)** for containerization, indicating it is designed to run as a containerized application.  

Currently, no specific description, website, or topics are provided in the repository, suggesting it may be in an early stage of development or intended for internal use.  

This README provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and basic usage guidelines based on the available information.
