# Server Rust

## Overview

The server-rust-1 repository is a Rust-based server implementation developed by beto-rocha-blockchain. The project primarily uses Rust (88.0% of the codebase) and includes a Dockerfile (12.0%) for containerization, indicating it is designed to run as a containerized application. However, no specific description, website, or topics are provided in the repository, suggesting it may be in an early stage of development or intended for internal use.

This README provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and basic usage guidelines based on the available information.

## Features





Rust-based Server: The project is written in Rust, leveraging its performance, safety, and concurrency features.



Docker Support: Includes a Dockerfile for easy deployment in containerized environments.



Lightweight Repository: Minimal setup with no external releases or packages published.

## Prerequisites

To run or develop this project, ensure you have the following installed:





Rust: Install Rust using rustup or your package manager.



Docker: Required for building and running the containerized application. Install from Docker's official site.



Git: To clone the repository.

Installation





Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/beto-rocha-blockchain/server-rust-1.git
cd server-rust-1



Build the Rust Project: Ensure Rust is installed, then build the project using Cargo:

cargo build --release



Build the Docker Image: If you prefer to run the application in a Docker container:

docker build -t server-rust-1 .

Usage

Running the Application Locally

To run the Rust application directly:

cargo run --release

Running with Docker

To run the application in a Docker container:

docker run -p 8080:8080 server-rust-1

Note: The port 8080 is an assumption based on common Rust server configurations. Check the source code or configuration files for the exact port.

Project Structure





src/: Contains the Rust source code (likely including main.rs for the server logic).



Dockerfile: Defines the container setup for running the application.



Cargo.toml: Rust project configuration file specifying dependencies and metadata.
